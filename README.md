# Interrupt Pro

A WoW Addon designed to help coordinate interrupts and crowd control in Mythic+ and Raids.

**NOTE:** This addon is currently a *work-in-progress*.

## Features (Proposed)
* Detailed guide of all dungeon and raid enemies and their abilities
* Display relevant info for the current target, including:
    * All abilities, highlighting critical interrupts
    * What forms of CC the target is affected by, tracking current DRs
    * What Mythic+ affixes interact with the target (Does it drop sanguine pools? Does it burst or bolster?)
* Track the remaining CD on party and raid members' interrupts and other forms of CC (stuns/fears/disorients/etc.)
* Set up assignments for "critical" interrupts, and get a notification when it's your turn to use your interrupt or CC
    * Assignments can be configurable manually or automatically by the addon
    * Targets will be deterministically auto-marked to help with interrupt assignments

## Slash Commands
* ToDo
